Install notes for Openpose+LFTD demo

-- For OpenCV camera support only
Install OpenNI2 from github.com/occipital/openni2 using installation steps there
get environment variables in `Packaging/Final/OpenNI-<version>/OpenNIDevEnvironment` before
building and installing OpenCV with OpenNI2 support from source - set cmake variable `WITH_OPENNI2`

-- OpenPose and LFTD models
Install github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation as user library `python3 setup.py install --user`
// Would be better to include this library in `packages` within repo instead of system install

Install LFTD pose model (`setup.sh`)
